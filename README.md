# hello-world
My first repository!
Hello everyone! This is my first time on GitHub, I am really excited to be on here and I can't wait to learn all the interesting stuff GitHub has to offer. 
My favourite color is Purple, I don't like cauliflower or watermelons, and if I could eat one thing for the rest of my life it would be PIZZA!
